# wcemu v0.0.1

## Changes from previous versions

- This is an initial release so no changes from previous

## Header

Every file generated in wcemu format starts with the following header pattern:

```c
// wcemu v0.0.1
// This file was created by <generator>
```

The most important line is the `wcemu v#.#.#` pattern, this should be the first line of the file so parsers can identify if it is compatible or not.

## INCLUDE

After the header are all includes. Includes are references to files relative to the current one that should be loaded the moment the include declaration is stated.

While it is possible to have includes inlined later in a file, at this time it is recommended to layout files with the expectation includes are after the header only.


```c
INCLUDE "PATH.TXT"
```

- Includes should be all uppercase as per the WLDCOM format directive, even if the file pointed to is all lowercase.
- TODO: Should we enforce a case sensitivity of files in an include? e.g. upper for INCLUDE param, and lower for file itself?
