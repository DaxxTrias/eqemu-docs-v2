# Custom Properties in EQGZI

Custom Properties are defined inside Blender. It is a way to convey custom EverQuest related information inside a .blend file to be set to EverQuest

## Material Custom Properties

- **fx**: Shader to use on this material. Examples of shaders can be seen in the [Shader List](shader-list.md)
- **e_* properties**: Each of these have a property value that are a type followed by a value, for example, the custom property `e_TextureDiffuse0` may have the value `2 ra_watertest_c_01.dds` set on it, defining a type of 2, and value of ra_watertest_c_01.dds.

## Object Custom Properties

### Object Region Custom Properties

A region is a cubic area that creates unique behavior within it. A classic region example is water or lava.

Note that all regions MUST have a prefix inside their object's name, the object name prefixes are: `AWT_`: water, `ALV_`: lava, `APK_`: pvp, `ATP_##_`: zoneline ## correlates with zone_points index, `ASL_`: ice, 'AVW_': Ice Lava? `APV_`: generic

Note also that all regions MUST be an empty cube. (Add, Empty -> Cube)

- **unknowna**: TODO: identify
- **unknownb**: TODO: identify
- **unknownc**: TODO: identify

Notes regarding regions after testing every combination [A-Z][A-Z][A-Z]: [B-Z][A-Z]P always results in a PVP region.  The 4th character doesn't seem to matter, but it existing is important to make the region work.  AVW and VW[A-Z] = Icy Lava, Damage type 246, with VWP resulting in Icy Lava PVP!  ALV, LA[A-Z] = Lava, Damage type 250, with LAP resulting in Lava PVP.   SL[A-Z] and WT[A-Z] were all water regions, with SLP and WTP resulting in Water PVP.

### Object Emitter Custom Properties

Particle effects are called emitters in EQ, and are defined by a zone_EnvironmentEmitter.txt file.

- **emit_id**: value based on [Environment Emitters](/server/zones/environment-emitters/)
- **emit_duration**: how long in ms an emitter should occur for. By default 90000000

### Object Sound Custom Properties

Sound custom properties impact the zone.emt file that tells the zone how to emit sounds, both one shots, and ambient sounds.

- **sound**: file name of a sound, default none.wav
- **sound_active**: when the sound should be played, default 0 (always). Other options: 1 (daytime), 2 (nighttime)
- **sound_volume**: loudness of a sound, default 1.0 (max volume), range of 0.0 to 1.0
- **sound_fade_in**: fade in in ms for a sound, default 0 (never fade)
- **sound_fade_out**: fade out in ms for a sound, default 0 (never fade)
- **sound_type**: loop parameter, default 0 (constantly), Other options: 1 (delayed repeat)
- **sound_radius**: when person is this radius from the origin play at full sound, default 15.0 (15m range)
- **sound_distance**: max distance from origin the sound can be heard, default 50.0 (50m range)
- **sound_rand_distance**: distance in meters the sound can be played at randomly, default 0
- **sound_trigger_range**: distance from origin for a player to trigger the sound being played, default 50.0 (50m range)
- **sound_min_repeat_delay**: minimum delay before the sound repeats playback in ms, default 0
- **sound_max_repeat_delay**: maximum delay before the sound repeats playback in ms, default 0
- **sound_xmi_index**: xmi is a classic playback system, typically just use, default 0
- **sound_echo**: echo level, default 0, range 0 to 1.0
- **sound_env_toggle**: set whether playback can be controlled with environment sounds in options window, default 1

## Object Door Custom Properties

- **door_id**: Index of door in the zone
- **door_opentype**: [Door Open Types](/server/zones/door-open-types)
- **door_guild**: Guild ID that can interact with door [Guild Schema](/schema/guilds/guilds)
- **door_lockpick**: Lockpicking Skill Required: -1 = Unpickable
- **door_keyitem**: Normal item ID, used as a key ([Item Schema](/schema/items/items))
- **door_nokeyring**: No Key Ring (default 0): 0 = False, 1 = True 
- **door_triggerdoor**: Default 0, 0 For Current Door or use a Unique Door Identifier
- **door_triggertype**: Default 0, 1 = Open a Type 255 door, 255 = Will Not Open
- **door_disable_timer**: 
- **door_doorisopen**: Is door open? (default 0): 0 = false, 1 true
- **door_param**: 
- **dest_zone**: Default NONE: Zone shortname clicking door takes you to ([Zone List](/server/zones/zone-list))
- **dest_instance**: Zone Instance ID clicking door takes you to ([Instance List Schema](/schema/instances/instance_list)
- **door_dest_x**: Destination X coordinate
- **door_dest_y**: Destination Y coordinate
- **door_dest_z**: Destination Z coordinate
- **door_dest_heading**: Destination heading direction
- **door_invert_state**: This column will basically behave like such: if the door has a click type and it is to raise up like a door, it will be raised on spawn of the door. Meaning it is inverted. Another example: If a [Door Open Type](/server/zones/door-open-types) is set to a spinning object on click, you could set this to 1 to have the door be spinning on spawn.
- **door_incline**: 
- **door_size**: Default 100, scale of object
- **door_buffer**: 
- **door_client_version_mask**: Default 4294967295: [Client Version Mask](/server/player/client-version-bitmasks)
- **door_is_ldon_door**: Is LDoN Door: 0 = False, 1 = True
- **door_min_expansion**: 
- **door_max_expansion**:
