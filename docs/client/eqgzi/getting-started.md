# Getting Started with EQGZI

## What is EQGZI?

As of **01/31/2023**, EQGZI is a program that turns a 3D modeled project into an everquest EQG zone file. It uses the OBJ format as an intermediary export, and supports: Lights, Environment Emitters, Material/Shader definitions, Region, and Spawn placement data.

## Requirements

- [Blender 3.0 or greater](https://www.blender.org/download/). This is the tool for editing zones.
- [EQGZI-Manager](https://github.com/xackery/eqgzi-manager/releases/latest). This is a standalone exe that manages EQGZI.
